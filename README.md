# flux-1-finetuning

This repo is designed to quickly  prepare a demo that showcases how to use OCI GPU shapes to finetune lora models of flux.1-dev. 
There are several projects that can be used to work with flux models
- ComfyUI[https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI] is a powerful and user-friendly tool for creating high-quality images using AI, including the FLUX model. It offers a modular workflow design that allows users to create custom image generation processes by connecting different components
- AItoolkit [https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI] is a tool that simplifies Flux fine tuning experience expoecially to reduce VRAM requirements. 
- SimpleTuner[https://github.com/bghira/SimpleTuner] is a set of scripts that simplify distributed fine tuning on multiple GPUs
